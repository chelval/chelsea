    <h3 style=" font-size: x-large; ">History of San Francisco High School</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style=" font-size: x-large; ">HISTORY:<br>

On June 9, 1954 San Francisco High School was born in the<br> midst of a small but busy community. It was first an annex of the <br> Quezon City High School with 90 first year students and 6 members of the<br> faculty to start with. Classes were housed in the rundown <br>Pizano building along Morato St.<br>
<br>
At the start, San Francisco High School's future did not seem <br>bright but inspired by the courage and determination of the<br> administrators and the Parent-Teacher association presidents; <br>they saw the fledging San Francisco High School grow<br> to what it is today.<br>
<br>
On Sept. 30, 1958 San Francisco Annex gained its independence from <br>the Quezon City High School. In the same year, the<br> Superintendent of City Schools, Pablo P. Reyes approved its holding<br> of the first graduation rites. To meet the growing<br> population, San Francisco High School opened an Annex at Judge Juan Luna. <br>However, later, that annex of SFHS acquired a 5,245 square meter <br>lot through a Presidential proclamation of the late President <br>Carlos P. Garcia in 1961.<br>
<br>
The enrollment had spiraled from 90 to 5,334 in 1970 and the original <br>three sections of 90 students with 6 teachers were<br> bolstered to 144 sections with 263 teachers in 1971.<br>
<br>
In November of the same year, the Q.C. Council approved resolution<br> No. 10590 s 75, changing the name of the school, San Francisco High School<br> to Don Mariano Marcos High School and was confirmed by a Division Memorandum <br>No. 32 dated October 23, 1975. However, the original name of the school was <br>adopted in October 1986 and up to the present it remains to be <br>San Francisco High School.</p>
